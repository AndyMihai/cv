  <p>I have studied in Romania at the University of Economics. I studied
    Economic Informatics with specialization of Statistics and Cybernetics,
    where I gained my initial economical and IT skills. Now, I am currently a
    student (BsS level 5) at University of Wales Trinity Saint David, specializing
    in Cloud Computing, server, cloud management and security.<br>
    I have knowledge of Microsoft Office pack (Microsoft 365), Microsoft
    Azure, Data center virtualization, Oracle Virtual Box (creating and
    maintaining Virtual Machines), Windows servers technologies (Active
    Directory Group Policies, Remote Desktop Policies).<br>
    In year 1 of studies, I have gain knowledge in Cisco technologies such as
    Packet Tracer, which means that I am able to design, build and deploy a
    network. Having good communicational skills is also very important in this
    role as it enables the team to work together and efficiently.<br> I am also part
    of the student committee which involves a lot of responsibility because
    my colleagues rely on my communication skills to connect with lecturers
    or other organizations, to solve their problems or concerns throughout
    the academic <br>
    This has given me more insight into analyzing codes and inputting data to
    a safe and reliable degree. It has enabled me to see how programs are
    made and the processes that systems go through to get to a working
    standard and enables me to test these systems out to ensure that they
    are working effectively.<br>
    I will bring my best assets and capabilities to the team. The ability to
    easily adapt to various situations and environments is one of my key
    strengths. I am reliable and a strong performer, I am proactive in going
    the ‘’extra mile’’ to deliver additional value for the service.<br> I feel ready for
    more responsibilities, a positive person, sociable, communicative, I
    always take care of the people around me, I always speak up, raising any
    concern, if there is any, always looking for a better way, able to work in a
    team and on my own.<br>
    I am professional and I have a calm attitude, also, I have the ability to
    work well under pressure, accepting instruction and constructive criticism
